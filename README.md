## This repository is about:

This repository contains my assessment submission for the module Computer Infrastructure. 

This proyect helps to practice automating weather data and collection. All is document in a Jupyter Notebook, ***weather.ipnyb*** explaining with details several steps and codes to achieve some tasks.

We use  ***CodeSpace*** on github to organized the files into  folders, gather weather data and use timestamps. Also, download weather information using ***bash scripts*** and tools like ***wget***.

Finally, to create a script (***weather.sh***) that runs automatically every day to download new weather data and save it.Using ***GitHub Actions***, youâ€™ll automate the running of your script, automatically updating your repository with the latest weather data each day
